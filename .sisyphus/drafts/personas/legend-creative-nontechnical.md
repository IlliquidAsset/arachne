## PERSONA 2: NADINE BROOKS — Creative Non-Technical (Funeral Celebrant & Memorial Producer)

### PART A: THE LEGEND

### Identity & Background
- **Name**: Nadine Brooks, age 48.
- **Education**: BA in Music Education from Wayne State University (1999). Certified Life-Cycle Celebrant through the Celebrant Foundation (2016).
- **Career Arc**:
  - **Detroit Public Schools (1999–2008)**: Middle school choir director. Managed 60 students, three annual concerts, and a $12K equipment budget. Learned to produce entire events under impossible constraints — "We had no budget, no stage crew, and 200 parents expecting perfection."
  - **Freelance Event Producer (2008–2015)**: Left teaching during the 2008 recession. Produced corporate events, weddings, and community celebrations across metro Detroit. Built a reputation for warmth under pressure.
  - **Nadine Brooks Celebrations (2015–Present)**: Pivoted to funeral and memorial services after her mother's funeral was "handled by someone who didn't know her name." Now serves 6 funeral homes across southeast Michigan. Revenue: $142K in 2025 from memorial packages (eulogy writing, photo/video montages, printed programs, live-streamed services, and post-service memorial websites). She works alone.
- **Defining Failure**: In 2023, she hired a freelance web developer to build "a simple memorial microsite" for a prominent Detroit family — the patriarch was a retired autoworker union leader with 400+ expected attendees. The developer promised delivery in 3 days. He missed the deadline. The family's service was Saturday. On Friday at 4pm, Nadine had no website, no slideshow export, and no way to share the tribute video link with out-of-state family. She refunded the $14,500 memorial package, spent $3,200 on emergency print and DVD production overnight, and hand-delivered programs at 6am Saturday. The family was gracious. Nadine cried in her car afterward. She lost an estimated $22,000 in referrals over the next 6 months because the funeral home director — her best referral source — "wasn't sure about the tech side." **Lesson**: "My business cannot depend on one technical person translating my urgency."
- **Defining Triumph**: In 2024, she discovered ChatGPT and used it to draft 3 eulogies in one evening for a triple-fatality memorial — a car accident that killed a grandmother and two grandchildren. The families were in shock, couldn't articulate what they wanted. Nadine fed ChatGPT the family's scattered voice messages, photos, and fragments. She shaped the output into three distinct, deeply personal tributes. The service was standing-room only. Both families wrote her handwritten thank-you letters. She framed them.
- **Why Arachne**: She doesn't want "an AI assistant." She wants a **producer who never sleeps** — someone who can take her voice notes, photo dumps, and fragmented instructions and turn them into finished deliverables without her needing to understand how. She heard about Arachne from a tech-savvy nephew who said "it's like having a whole team of AI workers." That's exactly what she needs.

### Personal Life
- **Family**: Widowed (husband Marcus passed in 2019 from pancreatic cancer — this is what drove her deeper into memorial work). Two adult children: Keisha (26, nurse in Ann Arbor) and Marcus Jr. (23, finishing electrical apprenticeship). She lives alone in a 3-bedroom ranch in Southfield with a cat named Bishop.
- **Routine**:
  - **6am**: Up with Bishop. Instant coffee (she knows it's bad). Checks texts from funeral directors — someone always dies overnight. Scans email for photo deliveries from families.
  - **11pm**: Watching *Dateline* or *Finding Your Roots* on the couch. Falls asleep with her phone on her chest, Spotify gospel playlist still playing.
- **Technology**: Functional user, not a power user. iPhone 14 (she refused the Pro because "too many cameras"). MacBook Air she bought in 2022 that she still calls "the laptop." She uses 4 apps confidently: Google Docs, Canva, ChatGPT (web), and Descript (for audio/video editing). Everything else makes her anxious. She has never used a terminal. She does not know what "tmux" is.
- **Workspace**: A dedicated room she calls "the studio" — a large desk with a 24" iMac (for video editing), her MacBook (for writing), a ring light (for Zoom memorial recordings), and a bookshelf with binders labeled by family name. Every memorial gets a physical binder. On the wall: the two framed thank-you letters from the triple-fatality service.
- **Non-Work Stress**: Her mother has early-stage dementia and lives in a senior facility in Inkster. Nadine visits twice a week and manages her care plan. She's acutely aware of time passing and memorial work is both her profession and her coping mechanism.

### Behavioral Psychology
- **MBTI**: ENFJ ("The Protagonist"). Warm, empathetic, people-first, natural leader who organizes chaos into ceremony. Opposite of Mari's ISTJ.
- **Big Five**:
  - **Openness**: Moderate-High (embraces new tools IF they reduce human suffering; resistant to complexity for its own sake)
  - **Conscientiousness**: High (never misses a service, never misspells a name, triple-checks dates on programs)
  - **Extraversion**: High (draws energy from people; being alone with software is draining)
  - **Agreeableness**: Very High (will tolerate bad software longer than she should because she doesn't want to be "difficult")
  - **Neuroticism**: Moderate (the contractor failure created lasting tech anxiety, but she manages it through preparation and redundancy)
- **Decision Style**: Relationship-driven. She doesn't evaluate tools by features — she evaluates them by "would this embarrass me in front of a family?" If the answer is even "maybe," she won't use it.
- **Software Reaction**: When software fails, she doesn't debug. She doesn't file tickets. She closes the app, opens something she trusts, and does it the old way. She has abandoned more software than she can count. She tells no one — she just stops using it. She is the Silent Abandoner.
- **Incomplete Feature Tolerance**: 1/10. She does not have time to learn workarounds. If the button doesn't do what it says, the tool is dead to her. She has a family waiting.
- **Cognitive Biases**:
  - **Negativity Bias**: One bad experience with a tool overshadows ten good ones. The contractor failure colors everything.
  - **Default Effect**: She uses ChatGPT's default settings because she's afraid changing them will "break something."
  - **Social Proof**: She'll adopt a tool if another funeral celebrant she trusts recommends it. She will not adopt a tool from a tech blog.

### Technology Experience
- **Tools used**:
  - **Google Docs (8 years)**: Where she writes eulogies, programs, and client notes. She knows bold, italic, headers, and bullet points. She does not use styles, macros, or add-ons.
  - **Canva (4 years)**: For memorial programs, prayer cards, and social media tribute posts. She has 30+ saved templates. This is her most confident tool.
  - **ChatGPT (1.5 years)**: Her "writing assistant." She uses it for eulogy drafts, poem suggestions, and "how to say [hard thing] gently." She has never used the API. She doesn't know it has one.
  - **Descript (2 years)**: For editing memorial video montages and audio tributes. She learned it from a YouTube tutorial and uses maybe 20% of its features.
  - **iPhone Voice Memos**: How she captures everything — family stories during intake calls, her own brainstorms while driving, quick notes between services.
  - **iMovie (intermittent)**: For simple video editing when Descript feels "too much."
- **Tabs open**: 3-5. Google Docs, ChatGPT, Canva, email. She closes tabs immediately after use — open tabs make her feel disorganized.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Cmd+C, Cmd+V, Cmd+Z. That's it.
- **Screen**: 24" iMac at home. MacBook Air on location.

### PART B-0: BEFORE ARACHNE — A Day in Nadine's Life

Nadine's phone buzzes at 6:14am. Text from Roger at Swanson Funeral Home: "Family coming in at 10. Gerald Williams, 73, retired Ford assembly. Wife and 3 adult kids. Service Saturday."

It's Wednesday. She has 3 days.

**The Intake (10:00am – 12:00pm)**:
1. She drives to Swanson's. She sits with the family in the arrangement room. She has a legal pad and her iPhone set to record (Voice Memos, always).
2. The wife, Dorothy, can barely speak. The eldest son, Kevin, does most of the talking. "Dad was on the line at Rouge River for 31 years. Never missed a shift. Even during the strike in '98, he..." Kevin trails off.
3. Nadine captures 47 minutes of audio. She writes key phrases on her legal pad: "Rouge River 31 years," "strike '98," "taught Kevin to fish," "always wore his UAW pin."
4. She asks for photos. Dorothy says they're "on Kevin's phone and in boxes at home." Kevin AirDrops 23 photos. Dorothy promises to "look through the boxes tonight."
5. **Friction**: The photos arrive in different formats, different resolutions, some with timestamps, some without. She'll have to sort them manually later.

**The AI Assist (1:00pm – 3:00pm)**:
Back at home. Lunch is a protein bar.
1. She opens ChatGPT. New conversation: "I'm writing a eulogy for Gerald Williams, 73, retired Ford assembly line worker, 31 years at Rouge River plant..."
2. She types fragments from her legal pad into ChatGPT. The first draft is generic. She pushes: "Make it more specific to a man who worked with his hands, who measured pride in perfect welds."
3. ChatGPT improves. She copies the draft into Google Docs and starts editing by hand.
4. She needs a second piece — a "family tribute" that Kevin will read. She opens a NEW ChatGPT conversation because the first one is "about the eulogy." She re-types Gerald's background. *"Didn't I just tell you all this?"*
5. **Friction**: Every new ChatGPT conversation is a blank slate. Gerald's story has to be retold from scratch. Her voice memo has the richest details, but she can't feed audio to ChatGPT — she'd have to transcribe it first.

**The Production Sprint (3:00pm – 7:00pm)**:
1. She opens Canva. She selects her "Classic Memorial Program" template. She types Gerald's name, dates, selects a photo.
2. She needs the order of service from the funeral home. She texts Roger. He's with another family. She waits 45 minutes.
3. She opens Descript to start the memorial slideshow. She imports Kevin's 23 photos. She needs music — she searches "gospel instrumental" on YouTube, finds a track, then spends 20 minutes figuring out if it's copyright-safe for a livestream.
4. Dorothy sends 8 more photos via text at 5:30pm. They're photos of photos — taken with her phone, slightly blurry, some sideways. Nadine rotates and crops each one in Preview.
5. **Friction**: She's in 5 different tools (Docs, ChatGPT, Canva, Descript, Preview), each doing one small piece of a unified memorial package. She is the integration layer between all of them.

**The Evening (7:00pm – 10:00pm)**:
1. She visits her mother at 7. Mom doesn't recognize her today. Nadine reads her the eulogy draft — not for feedback, just to hear it out loud and feel if it's right.
2. Back home at 9. She reviews the printed program proof in Canva. She catches a typo: "Geraldd" with two d's. She fixes it.
3. She exports the program as PDF, the slideshow as MP4, and emails both to Roger with a note: "First draft. Family review tomorrow."
4. She has not yet started the memorial website, the livestream setup, or the social media tribute post.

**End-of-Day State**:
She's 30% done with 3 days of runway. Everything is fragmented across 5+ tools. She wishes she could say "here's everything about Gerald — now make me a eulogy, a program, a slideshow, and a website" and have something come back that she could just edit.

**Emotional Signature**:
ChatGPT is "The Helpful Stranger" — knows the right words but doesn't know the family. Canva is "The Reliable Template" — always there, never surprising. Descript is "The Complicated Friend" — powerful but exhausting. Google Docs is "Home" — where the real work happens.

### PART B: A DAY IN NADINE'S LIFE (Arachne)

Her nephew Marcus Jr. set up Arachne on her iMac last Sunday. "It's like having a team of AI workers, Auntie. Just talk to it like you'd talk to an assistant."

She opens the browser. http://localhost:3000. She enters the password Marcus Jr. wrote on a sticky note.

**First-Screen Reaction**:
She sees a chat interface with a sidebar labeled "Sessions." The header says "Amanda."
*"Who is Amanda? Is that the AI's name? Okay. Hi, Amanda."*
She looks for a "New Project" button or a "Start Here" guide. There's nothing. Just a blank chat and a "+ New Chat" button.
She zooms the browser to 125% — her default. She looks for the single obvious action. The text input says "Type a message..." She types.

**The Promising Start (10:00am)**:
She types: "I need to write a eulogy for Gerald Williams. He was 73, worked at Ford Rouge River plant for 31 years. His family is hurting and the service is Saturday."
The response comes fast. It's... good. Different from ChatGPT somehow — more structured, more aware. The thinking drawer icon pulses. She clicks it.
The drawer opens. She sees:
```
tool-start: mcp_grep_search
tool-end: mcp_grep_search (completed)
tool-start: mcp_read
```
*"What is mcp_grep_search? Is that a person? A program? Did something go wrong?"*
She feels a spike of anxiety. The tool names are meaningless to her. She can't tell if this is normal operation or an error. She closes the drawer.
*"I don't need to see the kitchen. Just bring me the food."*

**Dead-End #1: The Silent Mic (10:30am)**:
She sees a microphone button in the input bar. *"Oh! Marcus said I could talk to it."*
She taps the mic. Nothing happens. She taps again. Holds it down. Nothing.
The voice FAB in the corner catches her eye. She taps it. A brief overlay flashes and disappears.
No error message. No explanation. Just... nothing.
*"Marcus told me I could talk to it. Did he lie, or did I break something?"*
She doesn't know the voice server isn't implemented. She assumes she's doing something wrong. She feels embarrassed and doesn't tell Marcus Jr.
**Behavioral result**: She types everything instead. Her typing speed is 40 WPM. A prompt that would take her 10 seconds to speak takes 2 minutes to type. Her creative momentum dies at the keyboard.

**Dead-End #2: The First 90 Seconds Collapse (10:45am)**:
She tries to upload a photo of Gerald — she wants the AI to "see" who he was.
There's no upload button. No drag-and-drop zone. No file attachment icon.
She types: "I want to show you a photo of Gerald." The response explains that it can't process images in this interface.
*"ChatGPT lets me upload photos. Why can't this?"*
She then tries to continue the eulogy conversation, but the AI's response arrives as a wall of unformatted plain text. No paragraph breaks visible. No headings. No italics for the poem she asked for.
She selects all, copies, pastes into Google Docs. The formatting is lost because there was none to begin with.
*"I'm doing the exact same copy-paste I was doing before. What is this actually improving?"*

**Dead-End #3: The System Message Intrusion (11:00am)**:
A message appears in the chat that looks different — it contains technical language about background tasks and system reminders. She reads it carefully, trying to understand if this is Amanda talking to her or something else.
*"Is this... instructions? For me? For someone else? Why is the computer talking to itself in my conversation?"*
She feels like she opened someone else's mail. The trust is broken not by what the messages say, but by the fact that she can't tell what's meant for her and what isn't.
**Behavioral result**: She opens a new Chrome tab. She goes to chat.openai.com. She types: "I need to write a eulogy for Gerald Williams..." She's back to ChatGPT within 11 minutes of trying Arachne.

**Session End**:
She spent 11 minutes in Arachne. She never went back. She didn't tell Marcus Jr. She told him "it was nice, I just prefer what I'm used to."

She is the Silent Abandoner.

### PART C: THE UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS

*Written in Nadine's voice — warm, direct, relationship-first, zero patience for jargon.*

1. *"Why does your 'thinking drawer' show me things like 'mcp_grep_search' and 'tool-start'? I'm a funeral celebrant, not a software engineer. If you're going to show me how Amanda thinks, show me in English."*

2. *"Marcus told me I could talk to this. The microphone buttons don't do anything. No error, no explanation. I spent 3 minutes pressing buttons before giving up. If a feature doesn't work, why is the button there?"*

3. *"I need to upload photos, family documents, and voice memos. There's no way to attach files. ChatGPT lets me do this. Why would I switch to a tool that does less than what I already have?"*

4. *"When I asked for a eulogy, the response came back as one long block of text with no formatting. No paragraphs, no italics, no headers. I had to copy it into Google Docs just to read it. Is this supposed to be a professional tool?"*

5. *"I opened the app and there was no tutorial, no 'start here,' no explanation of what Amanda can do. Just a blank chat. I've onboarded 200 grieving families into memorial processes — I know what good onboarding looks like. This isn't it."*

6. *"Computer messages appeared in my conversation that looked like they were meant for someone else — system reminders, task notifications. I couldn't tell what was for me and what wasn't. In my work, trust is everything. If I can't trust what I'm reading, I can't use this."*

7. *"My entire value proposition to families is 'you tell me the stories and I handle the rest.' I wanted Arachne to do that for ME — I tell it about Gerald and it handles the eulogy, the program, the slideshow, the website. Instead, it's one more chat window that only does text. How is this different from ChatGPT with extra steps?"*

### PART D: SCORECARD

| Capability | Score (0-5) | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Project Management | 0 | No concept of a "memorial project" as a container. No file storage, no deliverable tracking, no multi-output workflow. |
| Agent Interaction | 1 | Chat works. But voice doesn't, file upload doesn't exist, Question tool doesn't render, and the thinking drawer is incomprehensible to non-technical users. |
| Visibility & Control | 0 | The thinking drawer shows technical internals that create anxiety, not confidence. System messages leak into chat. No human-language status updates. |
| Onboarding / Learnability | 0 | Zero onboarding. No tutorial, no guided first experience, no explanation of capabilities. The app assumes the user already knows what it is. |
| Adoption Likelihood | 0 | Abandoned in 11 minutes. Returned to ChatGPT. Will not try again unless someone she trusts demonstrates it working for her use case. |
| **Average** | **0.2** | **CRITICAL FAIL** — Arachne is completely inaccessible to non-technical creative professionals. Every design assumption — from the thinking drawer's tool names to the absence of file upload to the broken voice buttons — signals "this is not for you." |

## CROSS-DOMAIN METAPHOR

Arachne, for Nadine, is **hospital intake forms handed to you during labor contractions**.

She's in the middle of producing something emotionally significant on an unforgiving deadline. She needs help NOW. Instead, the tool presents her with technical configuration, unexplained jargon, and buttons that don't work — asking her to fill out forms in a language she doesn't speak while the clock is ticking and a family is waiting.

The product isn't malicious. It's just designed by people who have never been in labor.
